This will be the homework assignments. Another, equally interesting file (master) will contain a set of errors and test files. But there's a problem: in the end, I couldn't push the files to the repository via the terminal. Enjoy :)

Task 1 - This C++ program calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given range. The user enters two numbers through a validation system that prohibits the entry of letters, symbols, fractions, and negative numbers using "std::numeric_limits." The program uses a mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression. Instead of sequentially iterating through each number, the program calculates the result using the formula: "n × (first even + last even) ÷ 2," where n is the number of even numbers in the range. For example, for the numbers 3 and 10, the program calculates "5 × (4 + 10) ÷ 2 = 35." The program is organized into two classes: "InputValidator," which handles data input, and "EvenSumCalculator," which performs the calculations. A try-catch block is also included, which checks for any errors and then terminates the program with an error message.
